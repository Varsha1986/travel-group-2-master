                <p id="Showpara11">Adventurous travelers will enjoy the selection of street food to choose from or may even try cocoa leaf tea, which is said to help with altitude sickness. With a wealth of museums to get grounded in Bolivia’s history and markets to get to know their culture, La Paz is easily more charming than congested.</p>
